  * 1.2.2 released. Fixed bugs. Introduced a new command line option --timeout= to set the 
    dialog window timeout in seconds. Added optional header message, read from file ~/.wmjump/wmjump-message;
    this is useful e.g. for showing time.

  * 1.2 released. Fixed a bug in rich text formatting. Also fixed a bug in
    the --pipe mode which in some circumstances drove wmjump into an endless
    loop.

  * 1.1 released. Introduced new command line options --rich (using rich text in
    the wmjump window), --location (to adjust the location on screen), --easy,

    on Google Code for details.

  * 1.0 released. Now pressing the space bar brings up the previous window;
    this is useful when you have to jump back and force between two windows.
    Also fixed a bug, now wmjump properly reports its own window class (wmjump).

10 Mar 2009 Andrei Mikhailov <a.mkhlv@gmail.com>
  * 0.9 released. StumpWM compatibility mode, command line option -g. 
    New command line options --persist, --reverse. Now the wmjump window is
    auto-destroyed when the focus is lost, unless if wmjump is started with
    the command line option --persist. The new option --reverse gives the
    list of windows in the opposite order.

    to show windows only on the current desktop.

  * 0.6 released.  The color of the button text is now configurable;
